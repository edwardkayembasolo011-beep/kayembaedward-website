                  <p><u>Every</u> cookie made made at Edward Cookie Company is
                        crafted with only the finest ingredients. Butter from grass fed cows,
                        Unbleached flour with the best flavour and textures. Organic sugar only from
                        India. Eggs from chickens that listen to classical music. Even our wateris
                        special. It comes from the Cascade Mountain springs that we hike up to
                        retrieve.</p>
                  <p>Baking is our passion and we take it very seriously.</p>
